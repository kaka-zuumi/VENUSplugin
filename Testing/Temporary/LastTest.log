Output:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A requested component was not found, or was unable to be opened.  This
means that this component is either not installed or is unable to be
used on your system (e.g., sometimes this means that shared libraries
that the component requires are unable to be found/loaded).  Note that
PMIx stopped checking at the first component that it did not find.
